# Asynchronous JavaScript Operations

## Overview

Welcome to your practical exercises on handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript! This lesson is designed to help you understand and apply different methods to manage asynchronous code in JavaScript, including callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await. You will start by working with traditional callbacks, refactor them into Promises, and finally use Async/Await to simplify and enhance readability.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement basic asynchronous operations using callbacks.
- Learn to refactor callback-based code into Promises and understand the benefits.
- Master the Async/Await syntax to write clean and efficient asynchronous code.

## Files Description

This lesson includes several JavaScript files, each focusing on a different aspect of asynchronous handling. Here's what each file is intended for:

- **`callbacks_practice.js`**: Contains basic exercises to implement asynchronous operations using callbacks.
- **`promises_practice.js`**: Includes tasks to refactor the callback-based solutions from `callbacks_practice.js` into Promises.
- **`async_await_practice.js`**: Tasks to convert the Promise-based solutions from `promises_practice.js` into Async/Await.
- **`callback_hell_example.js`**: Demonstrates a complex nested callback scenario, commonly known as "callback hell".
- **`callback_hell_promises.js`**: A file to refactor the nested callbacks from `callback_hell_example.js` using Promises.
- **`callback_hell_async_await.js`**: Further refactor the Promises code in `callback_hell_promises.js` into Async/Await.

## Instructions

1. **Read and Understand**: Start by reviewing the `callback_hell_example.js` to understand the complexity of nested callbacks.
2. **Refactor**: Move on to `callback_hell_promises.js` and `callback_hell_async_await.js` to refactor the code into Promises and then Async/Await, respectively. Apply similar refactoring techniques to the problems in `callbacks_practice.js`.
3. **Implement and Test**: For each file, implement the required functions and test them to ensure they work correctly. Handle errors gracefully and ensure your code is clean and well-commented.
4. **Submit**: Once completed, submit your refactored files as per the course's submission guidelines.

## Where to Learn More

- [Node.js fs Module](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html): Official documentation for the `fs` module.
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/async): Provides a good foundation for understanding asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous): Detailed explanations and tutorials on asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Recognize and resolve the issues related to "callback hell".
- Comfortably refactor callback-based JavaScript code to use Promises and Async/Await.
- Appreciate the syntactical and practical benefits of modern JavaScript asynchronous patterns.

## Assessment Criteria

Your code will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Functionality: All asynchronous operations must work as intended without errors.
- Code Quality: Use of proper coding conventions, including meaningful variable names and comments.
- Error Handling: Proper handling of possible errors in asynchronous operations.
- Refactoring Skills: Ability to transform complex nested callbacks into cleaner code using Promises and Async/Await.

Good luck, and enjoy the process of mastering asynchronous JavaScript operations!
